# p2p-dht

Part of a project at HTW to build a distributed full-text-search. [See the rest
of the project.](https://github.com/htw-projekt-p2p-volltextsuche)

This repo implements the DHT that hosts the entries of the inverted index for
the [full-text-search component](https://github.com/htw-projekt-p2p-volltextsuche/fulltext-search).

The [slides](https://github.com/htw-projekt-p2p-volltextsuche/vortrag/blob/master/slides.pdf) of our closing presentation include an explaination of how this whole project
fits together and takes a deeper look into what this component does if you want
to know more.
